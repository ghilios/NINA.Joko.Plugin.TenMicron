* NOTE: This plugin is still in active development *

# Features #

* Build full sky models using Golden Spiral in an Imaging tab dock
* Sidereal Path model point generation that creates points along the sidereal path of a DSO
* Advanced Sequencer items to build, load, and save models as part of a sequence
* MW4 and NINA horizons supported. Load the horizon file in NINA Options -> General
* Dome optimization to reduce dome slews during model build
* View and save loaded alignment models
* Load and Delete existing alignment models
* Remove the worst alignment star from a loaded alignment model
* Retry individual points that have high RMS
* Retry model build failures using only the failed points, unless a maximum number of failures is exceeded

# Coming Soon #

* Altitude-aware dome shutter calculations. By setting a dome shutter width in the model builder settings, a wider dome slit clearance will be used for higher altitudes to further reduce the number of dome slews
* Advanced Sequencer item to build full-sky models
* Advanced Sequencer item to set tracking rates not exposed by the ASCOM driver
